/*
    Cookies : Cookie is a file that is Stored by the browser is sent every request 
            to the server and sever sends back the exact same file to the browser.
            Cookie is Edited By the Browser and Server Also.

    Usage of Cookie : Cookie use to store some kind of data or information related to 
            the user to enstablishing the user's identity and products which user browse 
            for.
    Cookie stores data in key Value Pairs same as object .
    
    Cookie is uses to find out which user sends the request, because every time user post
    or do some other kind of thing it's very painful to enter id and password again and again

    Limited Storage in Browser is Available to stores the cookie if size of cookie exceed that
    limit browser automatically clear the cookie

    Cookie Stores the Identity Because every time you refresh the page in facebook then it's not
    asking you id and password again and again because your identity stores in cookie. and cookie
    is encrypted so that you can't be understand it, and whenever you loggedin in into the facebook
    and if you clear the facebook cookie then when ever your page is refreshed you need to loggedin
    again because facebook lost your identity which is stored in cookie and whenever you clear the 
    cookie your identity was lost and for knowing your identity facebook loggedout your profile 
    automatically and tells you to re-logged in so that again your identity and connection would be 
    enstablished

    EveryTime You loggedin your id password goes to server then server sends id password to the 
    database to check if this id password is exist or not. if id password is exist then a controller
    function which is exist on server ceate an encrypted token for you which is stores in cookie
    and sends to the browser so that what ever action you do cookie is transact in every action

    Cookie is send and received every time. When you sends request to the server Cookie is sent by the 
    browser with request and whenever server respond cookie is received to the browser which is sent 
    by the server.
