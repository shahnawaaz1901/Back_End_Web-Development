/* Template is What We Know Already in C++ */

// Template allows us specify dataType at the time of declaration for a specific data type

/* 
For Example if You make a class whithout template then You wouldn't be able to Use that 
Class for Another Data Type. For Use in Multiple Data Type of Single Class You Can Use
Template, Similar Type of Work is Done by Template Engine in BackEnd Web Development
*/

/*
For Example :- 
In FaceBook Front End Code is Same , multiple Sections is Same for All User, But Content
is Different for All User, it's Not Mean that Developer Write Code For Every User.
Developer Create that Front End Web Page Using Template Engine So that When Ever a User 
Specific Data(Eg. Friends, chats, Timeline) is Required it goes to Database fetch Data or 
Link from database for that Specific User and Display Things Over the Browser
