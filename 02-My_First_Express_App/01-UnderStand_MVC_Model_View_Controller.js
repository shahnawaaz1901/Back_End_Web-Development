/* 
WhenEver Your Browser Sends Request For You To Render WebPage First it Goes to Router,
Router checks the Request type Like it's a Homepage Request For a Perticular Web Page or
Contact Request or Some Other kind of Requests. Then Request Type is Gone to 'Controller' then
finds the mapped function corresponding to that Request and After that Controller Goes to 'View'
View Helps Controller to Read the Relevent file and After Reading 'View' sends Data to the Controller
Controller Sends Data to the Browser and Browser Render that Web Page
Sometime Controller Require Some Specific Content to a Specific User, 
Like in facebook For a Specific Person Friends are Different From Others. For Getting 
Information Controller Sends Request to 'Model', 'Model' is Directly Interconnected to Database
(Database is Permanent Storage Where All Data of All Users is Stored). and get Relevent 
Information From DataBase and Send Information to Controller, Controller Sends Information to
'View' to Read the File and After that sends Data to Browser and Browser Render All Information
to the Screen.
